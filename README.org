* Intro
This is a work in progress
This is my arch linux hyprland setup. i have gotten different things from different places. but customized it all to my liking
I will walk through the install process and setup.
All of my config files are actually in .org mode through emacs. i used doom emacs to set it all up
But this Org file will walk through the install process of everything. Except Arch Linux. I will assume you already have that.

Feel free to give me comments or opions on all of it. i am learning it all as i go. I just really liked how org mode was setup so I tried to make everything that

If you would like the exact setup i am using at the moment here it is:

To make it easy i install Arch linux with the kde desktop to start with and then install everything else. installing kde allows for easy wifi and copy and paste from emacs(or other notes) into terminal. this is optional but I use it as a backup incase hyprland breaks.

* Git Clone this git
Copy this .org file and all the rest of the files to the system then follow the steps bellow to get everything needed for it to run


* Yay installation
Installing Yay on Arch Linux

Before you go on with Yay installation, you need some packages required to build it.
Let me divide it into steps.

** Step 1: Install the prerequisite packages
It is always a good idea to refresh the package cache and update the system first:

#+begin_src
Sudo pacman -Syu
#+end_src

Install the rerquired base-devel (contains tools such as makepkg etc) and git (required for cloning the yay git repository).
#+begin_src
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git
#+end_src

With the --needed flag, it will NOT reinstall the already installed packages.

Now that you have the required packages, it's time to get Yay on your system.

** Step 2: Clone the Yay git repo and switch to it
Use the git command to 'clone' the Yay repo. You can do it anywhere in the system, be it your home directory or otherwise.
#+begin_src
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
#+end_src

Once done, switch to the cloned directory:
#+begin_src
cd yay
#+end_src


** Step 3: Install yay
Actually, you are building it. You'll see a PKGBUILD file here. Use the following command to build the package from here:
#+begin_src
makepkg -si
#+end_src

Follow the on-screen instructions. Press Y when you are asked to confirm.
Build yay package in arch Linux

Once the process finishes, verify that yay has been installed successfully by checking its version.

yay --version

Now that you have successfully installed it, you may remove the cloned Yay git repository. It is not needed anymore.

Using Yay for package management

The yay follows similar (but not identical) command structure as pacman. So it should not be difficult for you to manage AUR packages with Yay.

Search for packages with:

yay search_term

Install the packages with:

yay -S package_name

Remove packages with:

yay -R package_name

To delete a package with its dependencies:

yay -Rns package_name

Upgrading (only) the AUR packages:

yay -Sua

** Updating Yay on Arch Linux
ðŸ’¡
Yay is also capable of upgrading non-AUR packages. The a flag in yay -Sua restricts it to AUR packages only.
Also, it is recommended to not use sudo with yay. You'll be asked to enter the account password when it actually starts to install a package on your system.
Upgrading Yay to a new version
Now, you may wonder how you can upgrade Yay to a newer version when it's available.
The answer is that you don't have to do anything special. Yay can update itself when you run the command:

yay -Sua

** Removing Yay from your Arch system
If you don't like Yay or no longer need it anymore, you can remove it like any other package with the pacman command:

sudo pacman -Rs yay

* Installing Hyprland and other packages

Run the following command to install hyprland and the other programs needed

yay -S --needed hyprland waybar kitty emacs thunar wallust qt6ct gtk-4.0 sddm adobe-source-code-pro-fonts noto-fonts-emoji otf-font-awesome ttf-droid ttf-fira-code ttf-jetbrains-mono ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd firefox hyprcursor hyprutils aquamarine hypridle hyprlock hyprland pyprland aylurs-gtk-shell cliphist curl grim gvfs gvfs-mtp imagemagick inxi jq kitty kvantum nano network-manager-applet pamixer pavucontrol pipewire-alsa playerctl polkit-gnome python-requests python-pyquery qt5ct qt6ct qt6-svg rofi-wayland slurp swappy swaync swww wallust wget wl-clipboard wlogout xdg-user-dirs xdg-utils yad



* Setting up doom emacs
this is how you setup doom emacs which emacs is needed to make the .org file show up nicely.
you also then only have to edit the .org files and do org-babel-tangle and it will print out all the src code blocks into the files.
if you make an update to the .org file run these two commands :save :org-babel-tangle

Now to install doom emacs:

** Dependencies
yay -S --needed git emacs ripgrep fd

** install
run the git clone command

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.config/emacs
~/.config/emacs/bin/doom install


Must add to .bashrc
        export PATH="~/.config/emacs/bin:$PATH"
And then run
        source ~/.bashrc

then run doom update
and doom sync

* Apply Config
copy .config folder from github to overwrite the .config folder on the machine
alternatively you can just overwrite the folders/ files you want to use
then reboot this should apply the configs when hyprland launches
